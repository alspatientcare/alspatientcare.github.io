I am Dr. Narender Sharma, a surgeon by training and profession. I run a nursing home called Vinayak Hospital in Gurgaon, Haryana.

My wife was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) in January 2011. Within a year, she had lost her ability to speak and was completely bedridden. She depended on caregivers to assist with basic daily tasks, including bathing, brushing, and changing her seating position. By 2012, she had also lost her ability to eat and swallow.

She had a PEG tube for feeding and later underwent a tracheostomy with Bipap support. She was hospitalized in the ICU twice, each time for five weeks, and also underwent four surgeries for the removal of kidney stones. When she passed away in August 2023 (12.5 years after her diagnosis, compared to the average morbidity rate of 2 years for her specific condition), she had the opportunity to see her sons grow and settle into their lives.

As an attendant/caregiver, my family and I faced various challenges related to daily tasks and keeping her motivated to stay with us. My training as a surgeon helped me find cost-effective and practical solutions to care for her. I want to utilize my experience to teach attendants and patients how to improve their lives by providing cost-effective and practical solutions to daily problems without compromising the quality of care.
