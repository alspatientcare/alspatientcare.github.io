1. For any neurological problems, your neurologist should be the first point of contact. However, for any other associated medical problems or treatments, you can rely on us.

1. We will teach the attendants how to communicate with the patient. Communication is perhaps the most crucial aspect of managing MND, as it becomes extremely challenging to care for the patient if they are unable to speak. In some cases, the patient may require hospitalization for 1-2 days to address this.

1. When the patient comes out of the ICU, and the attendants or caregivers are unsure about their ability to provide care, we can keep the patient in the hospital for 2-3 days. During this time, we will instruct the attendants in patient care and encourage them to perform tasks under the guidance of trained staff.

1. We will instruct the attendants on how to manage daily chores, such as shifting the patient, changing clothes, bathing, brushing, even when the patient is on Bipap, and catheterization, among other things.

1. We will also host interactive sessions with patients and attendants, where individual problems and solutions will be discussed initially, followed by group discussions involving 5-7 patients for better understanding. We will also provide advice on reducing the costs of various items and necessary home modifications.

1. If the patient's family wishes to attend an event or function (e.g., a wedding), we can accommodate the patient in the hospital. However, this service is available only to patients who have previously been hospitalized with us, and one family member must accompany the patient.

In the end, while we may not be able to cure the problem, we can certainly improve the quality of life for both patients and their attendants and caregivers. Here is a patient on BiPap in the 12th year of her illness.
